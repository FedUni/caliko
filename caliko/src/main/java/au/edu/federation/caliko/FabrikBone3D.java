	 * constrained with regard to the previous (i.e. earlier / closer to the base) bone in its chain.
	 * <p>
	 * By default, a joint is not constrained (that is, it is free to rotate up to 180
	 * degrees in a clockwise or anticlockwise direction), however a joint may be
	 * constrained by specifying constraint angles via the
	 * {@link #setClockwiseConstraintDegs(float)} and {@link #setAnticlockwiseConstraintDegs(float)}
	 * methods.
	 * <p>
	 * You might think that surely a bone has two joints, one at the beginning and one at
	 * the end - however, consider an empty chain to which you add a single bone: It has
	 * a joint at its start, around which the bone may rotate (and which it may optionally
	 * be constrained around a global axis via the
	 * {@link FabrikChain3D#constrainBaseBoneToDirectionUV(Vec3f)} method).
	 * <p>
	 * When a second bone is added to the chain, the joint at the start of this second bone
	 * controls the rotational constraints with regard to the first ('base') bone, and so on.
	 * <p>
	 * During the forward (tip-to-base) pass of the FABRIK algorithm, the end effector is
	 * unconstrained and snapped to the target. As we then work from tip-to-base each
	 * previous bone is constrained by the joint in the outer bone until we reach the base,
	 * at which point, if we have a fixed base location, then we snap the base bone start
	 * location to it, or if we do not have a fixed base location we project the new start
	 * location along the reverse direction of the bone by its length.
	 * <p>
	 * During the backward (base-to-tip) pass, each bone is constrained by the joint angles
	 * relative to the bone before it, ensuring that all constraints are enforced.
