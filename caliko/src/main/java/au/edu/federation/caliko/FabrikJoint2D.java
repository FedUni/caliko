/** 
 * Class to represent a joint used to constrain the relative angle between FabrikBone2D objects in an IK chain.
 * <p>
 * A FabrikJoint2D consists of a pair of constraint angles, which are:
 * <ul><li>A clockwise constraint angle, and</li>
 * <li>An anticlockwise constraint angle.</li></ul>
 * <p>
 * Both of these angles are specified in degrees, and are kept within the range 0 degrees to 180 degrees inclusive. The default
 * value of these angles is 180 degrees, which means that the joint does not enforce any rotational
 * constraints. To enforce joint constraints, the {@link #mClockwiseConstraintDegs} and {@link #mAnticlockwiseConstraintDegs}
 * properties may be set via the {@link #setClockwiseConstraintDegs} and {@link #setAnticlockwiseConstraintDegs} methods,
 * or alternatively on a FabrikBone2D through identically named methods.
 * <p>
 * Each FabrikBone2D contains precisely one FabrikJoint2D object, which does not have a specific location, but can be considered
 * to be attached to the {@code mStartLocation} of the bone. That a bone only contains a single joint may seem unintuitive at
 * first, as when you think about bones in your arms or legs, most bones are connected at two points i.e. with a connection at each
 * end. However, if you imagine working from a blank slate and adding a single bone to an IK chain, then that first bone has a
 * single joint at its base (i.e. start location) and there is no joint at it's tip (i.e. end location).
 * <p>
 * Following on from this, adding a second bone to the chain adds with it a second joint, which again can be thought of as
 * being located at the start location of that second bone (which itself is at the end location of the first bone). In this way
 * we avoid having redundant joints (i.e. 2 bones? 4 joints!), and by using the joint of the outer bone to constrain any inner
 * bone during the FABRIK algorithm's 'forward pass', and the bone's own joint when traversing the IK chain during the
 * 'backward pass', the correct constraints are enforced between the relative angles of any pair of adjacent bones.
 * <p>
 * As there is only one type of joint available when working with a FabrikBone2D, it would have been perfectly possible to
 * incorporate the joint functionality directly into the FabrikBone2D class. However, as the FabrikBone3D class allows
 * joints to be of different types, to keep the conventions the same across the 2D and 3D aspects of the Caliko library,
 * this separate joint class was created.
