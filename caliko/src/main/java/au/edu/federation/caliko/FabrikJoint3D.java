/** 
 * A joint used to constrain the relative angle between FabrikBone3D objects in an IK chain.
 * <p>
 * There are three types of joint available:
 * <ul>
 * <li>JointType.BALL - A joint which may rotate up to a given angle with regard to the previous
 * bone in the chain or with regard to a global absolute direction in the case of the base bone,</li>
 * <li>JointType.GLOBAL_HINGE - A joint which acts as a hinge, only allowing rotation about a globally
 * specified axis, and</li>
 * <li>JointType.LOCAL_HINGE - A joint which acts as a hinge, only allowing rotation about a locally
 * specified axis (that is, rotation about an axis relative to the current bones direction).</li>
 * </ul> 
 * Ball joints are free to rotate in any direction relative to the direction of the previous bone
 * in the chain. Setting the constraint angle to 180 degrees allows full freedom, whilst a 
 * constraint angle of 0 degrees will fully constrain the bone to the direction of the previous bone.
 * <p>
 * Hinge joints can rotate in both clockwise and anti-clockwise directions within the valid
 * constraint angles of 0..180 degrees. A global hinge is constrained to rotate about a global
 * axis, while a local hinge is constrained about an axis relative to the bone being constrained.
 * <p> 
 * Each FabrikBone3D contains precisely one FabrikJoint3D object, which does not have a specific
 * location, but can be considered to be attached to the {@code mStartLocation} of the bone. That
 * a bone only contains a single joint may seem unintuitive at first, as when you think about bones
 * in your arms or legs, most bones are connected at two points i.e. with a connection at each end.
 * However, if you imagine working from a blank slate and adding a single bone to an IK chain, then
 * that first bone has a single joint at its base (i.e. start location) and there is no joint at
 * it's tip (i.e. end location).
 * <p>
 * Following on from this, adding a second bone to the chain adds with it a second joint, which
 * again can be thought of as being located at the start location of that second bone (which itself
 * is at the end location of the first bone). In this way we avoid having redundant joints (i.e. 2
 * bones? 4 joints!), and by using the joint of the outer bone to constrain any inner bone during
 * the FABRIK algorithm's 'forward pass', and the bone's own joint when traversing the IK chain
 * during the 'backward pass', the correct constraints are enforced between the relative angles
 * of any pair of adjacent bones.
 *

	 * anti-clockwise set of constraints where, both of these directions are specified in the
	 * range 0 to 180 degrees.</li>
	 * <li><strong>JointType.LOCAL_HINGE</strong> - A local hinge is similar to a global hinge, but in
